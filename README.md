# 2048game
* 2048 is a sliding block puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli, durring a weekend.
the game's goal is to slide numberd tiles on the board to combine them creating a new tile with the number 2048. Although, you can keep playing it creating larger numbers.

## technologies used:

 * I used HTML to create the body for the game;
 * CSS  used for styling the game;
 * Vanilla Javascript to make the logic and make the game functional;

## instruction 

* use arraw keys to move the tiles.
* pushing the tiles to one of the corners ( top left, top right bottom left, bottom right) will merge the ones that have the same number, add them up until you get to 2048.
* start with the smallest number first
* leave the  highest number to the end and never place it in the middle tiles.
